# FOCUS — scheduler (what its own nightly job should work on)

The scheduler's Tier 2 job (`/nightly-batch`) is scoped by this file, same
as every other project. Difference: this project is the **meta-tool** that
controls all the other jobs, so its nightly run is a **review gate** — work
lands on a `nightly/<date>` branch for a human to merge, never auto-applied.

The repo now has a GitHub remote (`git@github.com:hf7y/scheduler.git`),
pushed by a human. The nightly still does NOT push or merge on its own.

## This project dogfoods its own system

The scheduler uses the exact pieces every registered project uses, no
bespoke ones:

- **Its files live in `.claude/scheduler/`** (this folder): `FOCUS.md`,
  `QUESTIONS.md`, `schedule.conf`. Registration symlinks them into
  scheduler's aggregation folders (`focus/`, `questions/`, `schedule/`) —
  `schedule/scheduler.conf` is already a symlink back to
  `.claude/scheduler/schedule.conf`.
- **Reports** go to `~/reports/scheduler/` like everyone else.
- **The backlog lives HERE, in this file** (the section below) — not in a
  separate `TODO.md` anymore (retired 2026-07-18). The scheduler has no
  tracker and no end users filing reports, so FOCUS.md is both scope *and*
  backlog. Introduce an idea by adding a line to the Backlog section; that's
  the whole intake mechanism.
- **Questions** (`.claude/scheduler/QUESTIONS.md`) for anything needing a
  human decision — appended, never acted on unilaterally.

## Current focus

1. **Migrate every project's `schedule/*.conf` onto the new
   `bin/scheduler-run` entrypoint, per `MIGRATION.md`.** The generic
   entrypoint + backwards-compat mechanism landed 2026-07-18; the confs are
   still on legacy `*_SCRIPT` wrappers. For each of `chezz`, `vkv-inventory`,
   `home-assistant`, `wtul`: READ its `~/.local/bin/<...>-loop.sh` wrapper
   (reading outside the repo is fine; **editing** it is not), copy each
   config variable into that project's `schedule/<project>.conf` runtime
   fields (`REPO_URL`, `<TIER>_PROMPT`, `<TIER>_MAX_TURNS`, `<TIER>_MODEL`,
   `<TIER>_PRECHECK_CMD`, …), and **leave the `*_SCRIPT` line in place**
   (commented) so nothing flips until a human drops it and runs `--apply`.
   Verify with `bin/sync-crontab.sh` (preview, NO `--apply`): output must
   stay byte-identical while `*_SCRIPT` is still set. One commit per project.

2. **Propagate the self-contained-folder model to the other projects** (what
   scheduler just adopted): each project's scheduler files
   (`FOCUS.md`/`QUESTIONS.md`) grouped under `.claude/scheduler/`, with a
   `SCHEDULER_SUBDIR=".claude/scheduler"` line in its conf so
   `bin/sync-crontab.sh` points its `focus/`+`questions/` symlinks there.
   This touches other projects' `.claude/` layout and their `/nightly-batch`
   command's FOCUS path — write it up as a per-project proposal in the
   report (and a QUESTIONS entry) rather than editing other repos from here.

3. Develop a TUI or webapp experience (whatever is slimmest) for the morning reports and other interactions. Maybe this ends up as a progam installed in my local bin. I'd like to open up a terminal, run "scheduler" or similar cool name, see at a glance what's scheduled. Then I should be able to see past reports, inline edit open questions, see what tasks each project has scheduled to run.

4. Lay the groundwork for a long term design which allows me to remove these github hosted projects from my system entirely. The code lives on github and only gets pulled if necessary to do work. If it's better to cache the downloaded repo somewhere, that's fine. The goal here is to clean up my working environment so me moving these projects around to different locations doesn't effect scheduler's ability to run their improvements.

   **Design direction (decided 2026-07-18 with the human — build toward this, don't
   land it in one run).** The blocker is that today's `focus/`+`questions/`
   symlinks point *out of scheduler into each project's local working copy*
   (`focus/chezz.md -> /…/chezz/.claude/FOCUS.md`). Delete that checkout and
   the symlink dangles — so "no local checkout" and "symlink into the
   checkout" are fundamentally incompatible. The batch already does NOT read
   through the symlink anyway: it clones `origin/main` fresh, `reset --hard`,
   and reads FOCUS.md from *that ephemeral clone*. The symlink is only a
   human browse/edit convenience, and edits to it still have to be committed
   + pushed before a clone sees them.

   The target shape that survives removing the checkout:
   - **Scheduler owns the human-authored scope.** Store each project's
     FOCUS.md (and QUESTIONS.md) *inside scheduler* as the master — the
     natural home is the existing `focus/<project>.md` / `questions/<project>.md`
     slots, but as **real files, not symlinks** once a project has no local
     checkout. The project repo's `.claude/FOCUS.md` flips from master to a
     synced artifact.
   - **The run injects scope into the ephemeral clone.** `scheduler-run`
     (or the engine) writes the scheduler-owned FOCUS.md/QUESTIONS.md into
     the throwaway clone after `reset --hard`, before invoking `claude`, so
     the project's `/nightly-batch` still just reads `.claude/FOCUS.md` as it
     does today — no per-project command change needed. If a question got a
     `> ` answer, the same round-trip carries the edit back.
   - **Repo cache, not a checkout.** Pull-on-demand into a scheduler-managed
     cache dir (keyed by repo, reused across runs — this is the dedicated
     clone the engine already maintains per `JOB_NAME`); a human moving or
     deleting the project's own working copy no longer affects anything.
   - **Migration is incremental and per-project.** A project keeps its
     symlink (checkout present) until it's explicitly switched to
     scheduler-owned scope; don't flag-day it. Design a single flag/marker
     (e.g. a conf field like `SCOPE_SOURCE=scheduler|repo`) that
     `sync-crontab.sh` reads to decide symlink-vs-real-file, mirroring how
     `SCHEDULER_SUBDIR` and the `*_SCRIPT` backwards-compat already work.
   - **Out of scope of this design, unchanged:** a project's *public intake*
     (e.g. chezz's web tracker fed by player chat submissions) is web-hosted
     and independent of where code lives — it stays as-is. Only the
     human-authored scope migrates into scheduler; do NOT try to pull player
     backlogs into FOCUS.md (two stores that would drift). FOCUS.md points at
     and prioritizes tracker items; it does not duplicate them.

   First verifiable pieces (pick off one per run, review-gate as usual): (a)
   a `SCOPE_SOURCE` conf field + `sync-crontab.sh` honoring it (real file vs
   symlink) with a preview that stays byte-identical for existing
   `repo`-source projects; (b) the inject-scope-into-clone step in the engine
   behind that flag; (c) the repo-cache reuse. Scheduler itself is the safest
   first mover (local-only, already dogfoods every mechanism).

5. Step 4 above should make it possible for scheduler to run on any machine, cloud host or my desktop, freeing up my laptop from this workflow. Since scheduler isn't usage aware right now, just lay the groundwork for features 4 and 5. 

6. Note: pushing this repo is now something scheduler can do itself. As long as that's revertable, it's just something that needs to be flagged for me to review (that it happened, what the consequences are/why I might want to revert it). To avoid conflicts with other scheduled jobs, we need awareness of effects. It makes sense to push/schedule this utility's development changes to occur after upcoming jobs are run, but before the morning.

## Backlog (the intake — add a line to propose an idea)

- **Sweep cadence** — sweeps (esp. chezz) may run too often; tune
  `schedule/*.conf` cadence, validate with a `sync-crontab.sh` preview.
- **Auditability** — largely addressed by `bin/build-services-view.sh` /
  `services/` and the `focus/`+`questions/` aggregation; keep current,
  extend if gaps show up.
- **Optimal-usage scheduling** — token/%-usage reporting per project and
  scheduling jobs into unused capacity windows; ideally never hit the daily
  usage-limit window while maximizing weekly usage. Larger; break into
  verifiable pieces (e.g. a `USAGE_GATE_CMD` sibling to `PRECHECK_CMD`, plus
  per-run token logging into the state dir that `morning-report.sh` sums).
  Don't attempt wholesale in one unattended run.

## Out of scope for an unattended run

- Anything that can only be tested by waiting for a live cron fire.
- Editing installed wrappers under `~/.local/bin`, the live crontab, or any
  other project's files.
  nightly still never pushes).
